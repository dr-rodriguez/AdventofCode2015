# Advent of Code 2015

Some Python code for my attempts at the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) for 2015.
This is not the most elegent or efficient code, but it works and is meant for my own practice.

I was able to finish it all in time. Never made the leaderboard, but I learned a lot of neat little tricks and had fun solving these puzzles.
